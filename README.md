# Spam-Email-Classification
Spam email classification is crucial for filtering unsolicited emails. Using the UCI SPAM E-mail Database with 4601 instances and 57 features, we build a machine learning model to distinguish spam from non-spam. Key steps include data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model training  and evaluation, achieving robust email filtering.
